You can join the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/wEkD2Dh) to contact the developers.

## Features

### Social Network Feature

This feature brings some of the common functionalities of other social networks, like Twitter and Facebook, to Discord. This bot helps make Discord be the only social network anyone would ever need.


![Social Network Example](https://i.imgur.com/XqujC86.png)

- `.createnetwork` => creates all the channels and roles necessary for a full profile server. This server will serve as a facebook group/profile or twitter profile page.
  - **#wall** => where you make your posts.
    - Anyone following you will have this message sent to their #feed channel.
    - Every message sent in this channel will get ‚ù§Ô∏è, üîÑ, and ‚ûï reactions added.
      - When someone taps the replay üîÑ reaction, it will repost that message in their own #wall channel, like a retweet.
      - When the heart ‚ù§Ô∏è reaction is tapped, a message is sent to notifications saying someone has liked this message.
      - What the ‚ûïis tapped, you will **follow/unfollow** the original poster.
  - **#feed** => the posts from all the people you follow.
  - **#notifications** => all alerts: someone followed you, liked your post, reposted your post, etc.
![Notification Example](https://i.imgur.com/nkuyvbM.png)
  - **#photos** => all your photos that you posted in #wall.
  - **@subscribers** => In case you want to ping users.
    - This will only work when you @subscribers and you assign the subscriber role to users. It is not done automatically to prevent abuse.
- `.follow @user` => follows a user so you can see all their posts on your own profile server #feed channel.

### Server Templates

Something missing in Discord is being able to make a new server using a template.

- `.createschool` => creates an entire server based on a school server template. Perfect for online schools like Forest Trails Academy.
  - @principles
  - @teachers
  - @parents
  - @students
  - @Guests
  - A category for each class is created
    - #homework-assignments
    - #class-lessons
    - #important-dates
    - #study-group
    - voice channels
  - PTA Category
    - #important-info
    - #questions
    - #meeting voice channels
- `.savetemplate` => adds the current server as a template that you can reuse in other places.
- `.removetemplate` => removes the current server as a template.
- `.createserver ServerID` creates a server using based on the template server you provided.
